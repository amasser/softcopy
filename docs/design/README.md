# softcopy

Softcopy came from a desire to go paperless with my home documentation but being unsatisfied with the options I found available.  A number of them were expensive and over-complicated for what I was looking for.  I wanted a system that was based around tagging documents for visibility and that's about it.  I didn't need multiple levels of users, I didn't need workflows and I didn't need enterprise.  I needed something easy that I would actually use.

I recently found that some home document scanners are reasonably priced and also support uploading documents to an FTP server without any kind of PC interaction.  Since I've had a scanner at home connected to a PC for a long time and that still wasn't easy enough for me to start scanning everything, I thought if I could just press a button and have something imported automatically into a system, waiting for me to categorize it when I had the ambition, that might be the solution for me. So that's why softcopy exists!

The initial goal is to have a web ui you can use to tag and search documents from and a built-in ftp server to allow a scanner to send documents directly to the server.

## This directory
This directory contains some dumps of my thoughts in regards to design and implementation.  There are some things I see as requirements in what I've written (tags, easy to use, etc) but a lot of it is also flexible.  See [thoughts.md]() for thoughts on specific parts.

### Mockups
The mockups are done using [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/) and exported to PDF for easy viewing.
